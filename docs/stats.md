# Overlap Statistics — Definitions and Interpretation

This document defines each statistic generated by the overlap analysis, describes how it is calculated, and provides interpretation guidance. It also includes example tables and chart references for two specific segments.

---

## 1. Definitions

**Interaction Intensity over segment**  
- **Definition:** The cumulative number of overlap *events* across all steps in the segment. Each event is a unique interaction between a runner from event A and a runner from event B, counted for every time step where they are simultaneously within the segment and within the ±60s time window.  
- **Calculation:** Sum over all steps of the number of interacting *pairs* at that step.  
- **Interpretation:** Higher values indicate more total overlap activity across the segment, factoring in both duration and number of runners.

**Peak Congestion**  
- **Definition:** The maximum total number of runners (combined from both events) present in any single step within the segment.  
- **Calculation:** For each 30 m step in the segment, count distinct runners from both events in the ±60s window, sum them, and record the maximum value observed.  
- **Interpretation:** Shows the worst-case density in the segment. This is often the key operational choke point.

**Unique Pairs**  
- **Definition:** The number of unique (runnerA, runnerB) pairs who share the segment at any time during the race.  
- **Calculation:** Deduplicate all overlap events across the segment to count each unique pairing only once.  
- **Interpretation:** Indicates total number of distinct cross-event runner encounters.

**PeakRatio**  
- **Definition:** Ratio of peak congestion to the total field size of the smaller event.  
- **Calculation:** `Peak congestion ÷ min(total runners in event A, total runners in event B) × 100`.  
- **Interpretation:** A higher ratio means the peak congestion step contains a larger proportion of the smaller field — more acute bottleneck potential.

**Intensity/km**  
- **Definition:** Interaction Intensity normalized by segment length in km.  
- **Calculation:** `(Interaction Intensity over segment) ÷ (segment length in km)`.  
- **Interpretation:** Allows comparing segments of different lengths on equal footing.

**Intensity**  
- **Definition:** Same as "Interaction Intensity over segment". Sometimes used when segment length normalization is not needed.

**DistinctPairs**  
- **Definition:** Same as "Unique Pairs". Included as a consistency check in tabular output.

## 2. Additional context on Peak Congestion

Peak congestion is the **maximum simultaneous headcount** in a given 30 m step. It is driven by:  
1. **Wave timing** — when the two fields physically meet in the segment.  
2. **Field density** — how tightly packed each event’s runners are when they meet.  
3. **Speed differentials** — affecting how long runners remain in the overlap zone.

For example, in the `10K vs Half` segment from **0.00–2.74 km**:  
- Peak congestion: **222** total runners (`16` from 10K, `206` from Half) at the 2.73 km mark.  
- This represents the front wave of Half runners catching slower 10K runners shortly after the race start.

In the `10K vs Half` segment from **5.81–8.10 km**:  
- Peak congestion: **1,250** total runners (`355` from 10K, `895` from Half) at the 7.XX km mark.  
- Here, the two fields are fully merged for a prolonged distance, sustaining high counts.

## 3. Example: Per-step congestion tables

### Segment 1: 10K vs Half — 0.00–2.74 km (Peak n=222)
This segment represents the earliest point of interaction between the 10K and Half Marathon fields.
- **Start-time effect**: The 10K starts at 440 minutes, the Half at 460 minutes — a full 20 minutes later. This means the 10K field is already well into their race before the first Half runners reach this overlap zone.
- **Field density**: Only the fastest Half runners reach this segment early enough to meet slower 10K runners. At peak (km=2.73), just 16 10K runners are present versus 206 Half runners.
- **Interpretation**: The Half field is still tightly bunched near its front end, which is why the Half’s contribution dominates the combined total. The 10K runners in this zone are slower pace outliers still within reach of the leading Half runners. This creates a short, sharp peak in congestion — more of a “wave front” interaction than a prolonged merge.

### Segment 2: 10K vs Half — 5.81–8.10 km (Peak n=1,250)
This segment occurs much later in both races, and it is where the two fields run together for a sustained distance.
- **Start-time effect**: By this point, the 10K runners have been on course ~24–29 minutes longer than the Half runners in the overlap zone. The Half field has caught up to and merged with a much larger slice of the 10K field.
- **Field density**: At the first step in the segment (km=5.81), 173 10K runners (≈28% of the field) are in the zone along with 886 Half runners (≈97% of that field).
- **Dynamics**: The Half’s high density comes from the fact that the segment is still relatively early in their race (≈km 2.7–5.0 on their course). The 10K runners present here are mid- to back-pack, slower paces that maintain position in the overlap zone for longer.
- **Interpretation**: This is a full merge, producing sustained high combined counts over multiple kilometers. Peak congestion of 1,250 runners reflects nearly the entirety of the Half field and over a third of the 10K field being co-located in the same course slice.

## 4. Usage notes

- All distances are **course distances**, not straight-line GPS distances.  
- Step resolution is **0.03 km** (~30 m).  
- Time window is ±60 seconds relative to the step’s reference time.  
- Counts are **distinct runners**, not pairs.
